# Disclaimer
I have stopped the work on this repository after researching the future of functional programming in Go and understanding that FP is not suited to the Go language. I am leaving this repo open for testing and keep playing with the generic feature in Go.

If anyone think otherwise or have an opinion on the subject you are more than welcome to comment on the discussion:
